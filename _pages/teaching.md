### **Computer Science Projects**
I try to update this list as frequently as I can, but you should be able to see the latest list of computer science projects I created on [my personal Github](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/CS-Projects).

#### **Operating Systems Projects**
1. [**Understanding Operating System Overhead**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/OS-Invocation-Assignment)  
In this assignment, students will explore the cost of context switching and OS invocation by timing System Calls and Signal Handling.
2. [**CPU Virtualization: User Level Threads and Scheduler**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/User-Level-Thread-Library-Project)  
In this assignments students will explore CPU virtualization by implementing their own user-level threading library and scheduler.

#### **Distributed Systems Projects**
1. [**Understanding RPCs: The Bulletin Board Web Service**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/GRPC-Bulletin-Board-Project)  
In this project, students will explore Remote Procedure Calls using the modern framework of gRPC and Google Protocol Buffers.
2. [**Restful Web Services: A Foodie Web Service**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/Foodie-Web-Service-Project)  
In this project, students will explore RESTful Design by implement a RESTful web service that also makes RESTful requests to external APIs.
3. [**MapReduce: Processing Reddit Data**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/MapReduce-Reddit-Project)  
In this project, students will explore distributed computing programming by using the Map Reduce framework to perform data processing on real Reddit Data in a distributed manner.
4. [**Networking: Remote Object Store Service**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/Object-Store-Project)     
In this project, students will explore the complexities of building communication channels as well as remote services by implementing their own remote object storage service.
5. [**Spark: Processing Reddit and Netflix Data**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/Spark-Reddit-Netflix-Project)  
In this project, students will explore distributed computing programming by using the Spark framework to perform data processing on real Reddit and Netflix Data in a distributed manner.

#### **Computer Security Projects**
1. [**Cryptography Complexity: Cracking Simple Substitution Ciphers**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/Cracking-Simple-Ciphers-Project)  
In this project, students will explore the complexity of simple substitution ciphers and try and come up with programs that can automatically break them using brute force/frequency analysis.
2. [**Understanding Encryption: Encrypting Files with Java**](https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/Cryptr-Java-Encryption-Assignment)  
In this assignment, students will explore how to encrypt and decrypt files in Java using public-key cryptography and symmetric key cryptography to carry out secure file sharing.
