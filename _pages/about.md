#### **About Me**
I am a currently second year PhD student studying Computer Science at Rutgers University. I am part of the Systems Research Lab in the Department of Computer Science and work under [Sudarsun Kannan](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~sk2113/).

Aside from academics I like playing around operating systems, cars, and photography. In my spare time, I like to work with my hands, whether it be working on my cars, tinkering with 3D-printing, microcontrollers, and building furniture.

#### **Interests**
Operating Systems, File System Crash Recovery, Distributed Systems, Storage Architecture.


#### **Mission Statement**
We live in a world of complex systems, things like macnine learning, IoT and social media is generating large amounts of data. I'm interested in researching problems with how we store and move data. I'm interested in how we interact with applications and the underlying storage that backs them. From data centers to consumer PCs, we should be able to fully utilize the capabilities.




**Currently Teaching Assistant for:** [CS416: Operating Systems Design](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~sk2113/course/cs416-sp20/)
